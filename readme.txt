Description:
This is my simulation of a programming language and CPU/memory. This project contains 1 cpp file and 2 header files. "main.cpp" is an empty file, and code will be written in the main() function. "yourlang.h" contains the code for my custom data types and custom functions that replace the default c++ types/functions. "CPU.h" contains code for my simulated memory and CPU system.

Challenges and Learning:
This project made me learn a lot about templates as they were able to solve many of my problems. The most challenging thing was being able to fully understand the concept of how the language and system interact. There was also a lot to learn about inheritance and overloading. I had to restart the project a couple times as I learned more while programming.
