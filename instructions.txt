Data Types

c++		My version		example

int		Cipher			Cipher x; //defult is 0
					x = 3;

double		Hover			Hover x; //defult is 0.0
					x = 4.3;

bool		Argument		Argument x; //defult is true
					x = false;

string		Chain			Chain x; //defult is ""
					x = "Hello World";

char		Figure			Figure x; //defult is '0'
					x = 'B';



Functions

cout		reveal()		reveal("Hello ", "World"); //Can take any amount of date in any type


cin		gain()			gain(x); //x can be any data type

if else		condition()		//takes in (bool, anyType1, anyType2)
					//if bool is true condition returns anyType1
					//if bool is false condition returns anyType2
					num = condition(4 > 5, 100, 200); //in this case num will be 200
					reveal(condition(2==2, "yes", "no")); //in this case it will output yes

for		reRun()			//takes in(anyType, int)
					//will output anyType for int amount of times
					reRun("Hello", 4); //will output Hello repeatedly for 4 times
					reRun(100, 6); //will ouput 100 repeatedly for 6 times



Example Program that uses all elements:

int main(){
    Chain name;
    Cipher age;
    Figure gender;
    Argument canVote;
    Hover money;

    reveal("Enter your name: ");
    gain(name);

    reveal("Enter age: ");
    gain(age);
    canVote = condition(age >= 18, true, false);

    reveal("\nEnter Gender (M or F): ");
    gain(gender);


    reveal("\nYou are: ",name, "\nAge: ", age, "\nGender: ", gender);
    reveal(condition(canVote == true, "\nYou are old enough to vote", "\nYou are not old enough to vote"));

    reveal("\nHow much money do you have: $");
    gain(money);

    reRun(money, 6);
    
};
